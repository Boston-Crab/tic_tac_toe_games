### -- Outcome --

Due to this project, I have learn about:
1. Mouse tracking.
1. How to import and use static assest in pygame library
1. Different ways of tracking the current game state.
1. How to devide program/game-window pixel area into desired smaller pieces/chunks.
1. Importance of making a seperate function for each feature of the project.
2. Writing Documentation that follows industry standarts.
