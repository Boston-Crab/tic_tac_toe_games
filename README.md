### -- General info --
During the first half of 2023, I've created a cmd based tic tac toe.
As a result of that, decision was made that the next good challenge would be to make a
Pygame conversion.

Youtube video link, in which you can observe the Pygame version:

### -- Outcome --

Due to this project, I have learn about:
1. Mouse tracking.
1. How assets are imported/used and blited/shown.
1. Different ways of tracking the current game state.
1. How to devide program/game-window pixel area into desired smaller pieces/chunks.
1. Importance of making a seperate function for each feature of the project.
